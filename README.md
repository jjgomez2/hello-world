# hello-world
This is a learning repository. 
Have I not learned enough outside the digitized world? This is a process, contineous many would say. I just noticed that there is no spell check in this page. Also, I noticed that as I continue typing beyond one the horizantality of the line, it continues without marking a number on the left hand side. 
When I hit enter, it seems to start a new paragraph

Maybe!
